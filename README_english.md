# Generali Data challenge 2020

A customer who fail to renew the policy (Customer Churn) is a classic problem for an insurance company. A problem that all business models based on expiring contracts face.\
Customer Churn prediction is the theme of this Challenge.\
A vital issue: anticipating it allows for example to leverage retention actions to maintain the relationship with the customer.\
The Advanced Analytics team of Generali Italy provides a dataset, extracted from its systems, on the basis of which you can develop a predictive model of Customer Churn. \
The accuracy of the predictions will be assessed using the F1 Score, i.e. the harmonic mean of precision and recovery (precision and recall) for the target category = 1 (Churn):\
The final classification will instead be determined by the F1 Score obtained on the remaining 75% of the test set.\
For this Challenge, the Advanced Analytics team of Generali Italia makes available a dataset, anonymized, which collects a series of information on customers who have subscribed to an automobile policy.
